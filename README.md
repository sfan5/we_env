Tools to aid the forming of "natural" terrain by hand using [WorldEdit](https://github.com/Uberi/Minetest-WorldEdit)'s brush.

This is more of a proof of concept and might be merged into WorldEdit in the future.

## Command reference

* `//fall`

Make all gravity-affected nodes in the current selection fall down.
Unlike the usual "punch to cause fall" this works en masse.

* `//populate`

Convert terrain (`default:dirt` only) in current selection to look like "real" terrain.
Meaning: Add grass on top and change deeper nodes to stone.

* `//smooth`

Smooth terrain in the current selection. When adding nodes, the type of the top-most node in the column is used.
This uses an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and should be ran 1 or 2 times to produce good results.

* `//smoothbrush`

Assign terrain smoothing (see above) to a brush.
Note that the brush will smooth a 10x10 area with heights up to 48 at once.
